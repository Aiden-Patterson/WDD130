      <h3>Starting the game</h3>
      <p>
        There are a lot of different strategies you can employ when playing
        Wordle. One of the best ones is to start off with a strong word. Most
        people agree that the best first word includes a lot of vowels. This
        helps with later guessing; since you know which vowels you need, that
        greatly reduces the number of words available. a popular choices include
        'AUDIO' and 'ADEIU' as a first guess.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also useful to include popular consonants in your guesses, as this
        can greatly narrow down a lot of possibilities. Words like 'AISLE' and
        'STARE' as a first guess.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose to not play in hard mode, a good guessing combination is
        to guess 'ADEIU' followed by 'STORY' right after. This guessing patter
        allows you to guess all vowels, as well as some of the most common
        consonants, which will give off a very strong start if you are willing
        to sacrifice your first two moves for the setup
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people have also done statistical studies to discover what word is
        the best word to start with. Some words that these computers and
        algorithims have decided on are 'CRANE' 'IRATE' 'LATER' and 'RAISE' as
        the best starting words. One thing of noter here is thta all of the
        words have the letters A, E, and R in them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just because a word is a good starting word doesn't mean it will always
        be helpful. Like in the picture below, the player put in the word
        'CRANE' but only got all gray letters. These words are designed to try
        and help you the most in starting out your game
      </p>

        />
      </div>
      <p>
        As an added layer of challenge, you could opt to use a different
        starting word for every time you play. You can still use the strategies
        listed above, but this adds the extra challenge of not being able to
        jsut stick to one good word. I personally like doing this, as it adds to
        the fun of the game and adds just a little more challenge to it.
      </p>
      <h3>The rest of the game</h3>
      <p>
        Always move around your yellow guesses. Yellow means that the letter is
        in the final word, but it isn't in the right spot. Keep these letters in
        your guesses, but move their position around until it turns green
      </p>
      <p>
        If you arent' playing in hard mode, make your guesses extremely varied.
        Don't use the same letters in your guess, even if they were a green
        guess the word before. This allows you to guess even more words a lot
        faster. In the example below, the player already knows 4 of the 5
        letters that they need in order to guess the final word by turn 2. This
        greatly narrows down the options for what it could be, with 'FRAME'
        being the final word.

        To solve Wordle as efficiently as possible, try words that include the
        letters E, T, A, I, O, N, S, H, and R; these are the most common letters
        in English. Another great trick is to begin with words that start with
        the letters A, B, C, and S. These letters are the most common starting
        letters in English.
