      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Wordle is a simple word-guessing game that has come out recently. With its simple design and ability to share your score with others, it has quickly become very popular. The main problem with the game is that there is very little replay ability. Wordle uses the same word for every player each day, so you can only play once a day before you know what word you are going to get. With website intends to fix that. It will include itâ€™s very own Wordle game that generates a new random word every time it is opened, as well as some strategy tips, so that players can test new ideas and try new strategies that can be implemented in the main game.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My website will be focused on anyone who likes playing Wordle and wants to get better at the game</p>  <!-- change this -->
