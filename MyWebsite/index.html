      <h2>What is Wordle?</h2>
      <div>

      <p>
        Wordle is a word guessing game. The game is to try and guess a random
        word within six tries. While this may seem like a daunting task, it is
        made easier by your previous guesses either confirming or disproving if
        the letters in the word appear in the word you are trying to guess
      </p>
      <div>
        <img
          class="wordleGame"
          src="images/Wordle 1 guess.png"
          alt="Wordle board with one guess"
        />
        <!--it would be really cool to make a script here that cycles through all of the game steps-->
      </div>
      <p>
        When a letter turns gray, that means that the letter does not appear in
        the word you are trying to guess
      </p>
      <p>
        When a letter turns yellow, that means that the letter does appear in
        the word you are trying to guess, but not in that position
      </p>
      <p>
        When a letter turns green, that means that the letter does appear in
        that exact spot in the word you are trying to guess
      </p>
      <p>
        If there are two of the same letters in the word, each letter will
        change color on it's own. In this example, the word that is being
        guessed has two of the letter 'b'b in it. because the player entered two
        of the letter, they each change color based on where the 'b' is supposed
        to be
      </p>
      <div>
        <img
          class="doubleLetter"
          src="images/double letter yellow green.png"
          alt="Wordle guess with two of the same letters"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        If, however, you guess two letters but the final word only has one of
        those letters, only one will be colored yellow or green and the other
        one will be gray. This allows you to know that there is only one of that
        letter used in the word
      </p>
      <div>
        <img
          id="doubleLetter"
          src="images/double letter yellow gray.png"
          alt="Wordle guess with two of the same letters"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Everyone recieves the same word to guess every day, and a new word will
        not be chosen until the next day. This way, everyone who plays the game
        will always have the same word to try to guess so you can challenge your
        friends and family to play
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the settings, there is also an option for 'hard mode.' In this
        mode, the game will not allow you to make guesses that don't include
        letters you have already revealed. If we use the 'KEEPS' example from
        above, we see that one 'E' is colored yellow. If we were playing in hard
        mode, every guess afterwards would have to use the letter 'E' in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game will also keep track of how many times you have won, and how
        many guesses it took you to guess each word. This is displayed at the
        end of the game in a statistics page
